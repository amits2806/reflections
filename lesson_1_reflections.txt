How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

i found that naming similar enum was different for the same function in both the files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It can help me what functionlaties i have added over time and can also give the complete picture 
of the current code.
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can always revert to the woking copy of working code and also can track down what change actually broke my code easily and more faster.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
realtime working
